# A Side Effect of Democracy

Statement: In a classical dictatorship, the opinion of the citizens does not matter. In a Democracy, the opinion of the citizens
matters, making it a prime target for attacks.

Intuition: Systems define Incentives. The system of Democracy, gives value to the citizens opinions. Value is desired.
Obtaining value is an incentive. Parties seeking value exist. Parties attempt to capture value. If parties lack moral
constraints, they attack the citizens opinions. Can create strong social divisions. Can belittle critical thinking
skills and inhibit their growth in a society. Critical thinking conflicts with the goals of capturing value. Dull the
people, so they accept the Parties arguments. Do not permit critical thinking to develop, it affects market prices.
