# The Theatrical Present

Statement: The most meaningful conversations do not take place in the present, but are mere plays of ones that exist in the past.

Intuiting: Meaningful conversations are usually identified when the participants can exchange strong, coherent, and
insightful back and forths. The surfacing of strong, coherent, and insightful back and forths is often due to having a
monologue in the past, regarding said topic. A monologue that perhaps was weak, incoherent, but had a hint of insight.
