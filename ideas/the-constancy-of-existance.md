# The Constancy of Existence

Statement: The more things change, the more they stay the same.


Intuition: There always exist an angle, a perspective, of any given change, by which the change is reduced to a
constant. (People are richer now! Things are more expensive now. People suffer less now! People create new means of
suffering). There is always a derivative that takes the rate of change to 0. One might bring about the notion that not
all derivatives can be made into 0. For instance the derivativ of e^x is e^x. I say true, but, if we go one dimension
above, and look at the rate of change of compound rates of changes, we notice that the rate of change was e^x, and
became e^x, their difference is 0. their rate of change is 0. They did not change. There is always a dimension to expand
into that would render any change constant.
